# Data Manipulation and Management

## Data manipulation Sheet 1 
This particular task exposes us to how to create a DataSet and how to manipulate the data with the use of **Sort/Filter** for easy analysis and also how to use **Conditioning Formatting Tools**, This helps to easily spot trends and patterns in our data with the use of bars and colours to easily highlight values

### Excel Task 1
For this task, we were asked to create a table with 20 rows of information in a worksheet with the following fields;
1. Employee ID
2. Employee Full Name
3. Department
4. Salary (between $5000 - $25000)
5. Job Type (Part-time, Freelance, Contract)

And Also sort the data to show only **Employees who are Freelancers** and **Highlight the ones whose salaries are above $10000**.

I created a dataset with the above fields bearing in mind the citeria for each field.
For easy understanding of the dataset, i formatted the header, highlighting it with a colour to different it. 
I copied the dataset into *SHEET 1*, *SHEET 2* and *SHEET 3* .
Then i proceeded to the second part of the task, which was to sort/filter the data and also formatting. To get this done, i selected the *Job Type* column only and clicked on sort/filter tool, then moved to a dropped bar on the Job Title and click on it, following the dropped down, click on Text Filter, pick *Equals* as the command and inputted *Freelance* since thats the only Job Type i wanted to get result for. 
Then, I used the *Conditional Formatting Tool* ob the salary column to Highlight the salaries greater than $10000.

## Data Manipulation Sheet 2
This particular task exposes us on how to spilt data into a different column by using the *Text To Column Tool* on the *Data Tool Bar*, for example: spilting Full Name into a different coloumn as first name and Last name. And also more information about *Conditional Formatting Tools*. How one can spot duplicated values. 

### Excel Task 2
For this task, we were asked to split the **employees' full name into First name and last name** and also check for **duplicates and highlight** if any.

I went to the **Data Tool bar**, selected the *Employee Full Name* column, then click on **Text To Column** on the **Data Tool Bar** select *delimited, this helps to set the delimiters your data contains, then selected *Space as the delimiter* as it is space that separate the first name and last name. Then proceeded to click on finish. The data was spilted and new data fix in a new column. 
Then, i proceeded to check for *duplicates*. To check for duplicates, i highlighted the *Employees Name columns * and clicked on the *conditional formatting tools* and select the *Duplicate values* option and proceed to format the desire colour.

## Data Manipulation Sheet 3
This particular task exposes more on other functions of the conditional formatting tools such as the *Top/Botton Rules, this rule helps to select data base on the rule set, such as Top/Bottom 10 Items, Above/Below average or based on specific values.

### Excel Task 3
For this task, we were asked to **highlight employees whose name begin with the letter 'E' (in yellow)**. Then **format the salary column such that the highest salary has a green background and the lowest salary a red background**.

I highlighted the *Employees name column* then went to the *Conditional Formatting Tools* and selected *Highlight cells rules then proceeded to pick more rules then inputed the specific text and picked the *beginning with* and inputed the letter 'E' all on the format only cells dialog box. Then i proceeded to format the colour to yellow and okay*.

The next task was to format the salary column such that the highest and lowest salary is highlighted. So i highlighted the *Salarycolumn* then went to the *Conditional Formatting Tools* and selected *Highlight cells rules then proceeded to pick more rules, on the format value dialog box i picked *Top 1* and proceeded to format the colour. I did same for the lowest salary by picking the *bottom 1* option*.
